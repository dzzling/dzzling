### Hi everyone!

I'm a student in computer science and journalism at FU Berlin. Given my academic background I love opportunities to work on projects relating both to ![Media](https://img.shields.io/badge/all_things-media-%231aa744) and ![CS](https://img.shields.io/badge/all_things-computer_science-lightgrey). Fun projects are - of course - included!

Feel free to stick around :)
